        <p>Story of your family when you were born!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-normal-text-justify content-font family-story-birth">
        <p>
          Your name is Eugenio, and you are born in a country called Nicaragua
          as a boy. You are born into a Bottom 10% family with a daily income
          of $2.32 per day per person. You are an intelligent child. Your
          family is living in the simplest shared accommodation where you are
          possibly sharing it with other families. Your family is having a
          meager quantity of food for survival with the possibility of at
          least one meal a day. You are born into a family that saves -0.87
          percent of its income, which means your family has more expenses
          than income.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your parents have never taken out loans so far. Therefore your
          family isn't in debt. Your family is currently spending 39 percent
          of its total income on diet and food.Your father, Octavio, dropped
          out from school. Currently he is working as a Shoe Cleaner. Your
          mother, Sara, is attending college. Currently she is unemployed.
          Your mother is in good health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your father is also in good health.Nicaragua's average household
          income is $ 9373 (331.7 K Cordobas) per year. The family you are
          born into is a family that earns $2.32 a day per person which is
          2541 dollars/year. The odds of being born as absolutely poor
          (earning less than $2 per day per person) in Nicaragua are 26%. Top
          1% of population (approximately 66.2 K people) owns 25.2% of
          national wealth. In other words, top 1% population share in national
          wealth is 5.14 times that of share of national wealth of bottom 50%
          population.Compared to your home country, India, when you are born
          in Nicaragua:
        </p>

        <p>
          You will have 1.03 times more access to attend primary school. You
          will have 6.33 % less likely to be unemployed. You will have 3.22 %
          less access to electricity. You will spend 2.46 times more cost on
          healthcare.Nicaragua, the country you are born in, ranks (1 is
          worst) 20 in corruption out of 193 countries in the world. In
          Nicaragua the life expectancy for men is 72.1 years and the life
          expectancy for women is 77.9 years
